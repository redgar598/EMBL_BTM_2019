# Not so scary shell?

## The black box

For many people the UNIX shell is something scary. Something unkown, 
something for nerds.

We will look at it and demystify the UNIX shell.


## What is the shell?
The shell is a command line interface on UNIX systems, so MACs, Linux and BSD
computer that will execute commands that are typed in it.

Windows as the CMD ot power shell that is similar but not the target of this
course. The UNIX shell is much more usefull and more widely used.

On Windows you can use subsystem for windows 2: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

## Wikipedia says

>A shell hides the details of the underlying operating system and manages the technical details of the operating system kernel interface [...]

So a shell is already a simplification for you. But many people don't feel like
thats the case. They got used to have a software with a graphical interface. 

The biggest difference between software like Excel and the command line is that
we type what we want to do instead of clicking on a button.

## But why would I use that in 2019?
Have you ever spent so much time doing a repetitive task using the mouse and 
maybe a webbrowser, like downloading all pictures from an article, or copying data from a measurement into excel?

Once these tasks require more then a few hundred clicks, you will want to have 
an automated way of doing them. Thats where the shell comes in.
