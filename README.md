# Welcome Basic Teaching Module 2019

In the BTM 2019 current predocs prepare modules and lectures to help the new predocs to get started with the predoc course and the rest of their PhD at EMBL.

## Recommended Software
### Anaconda
- Most software we will use can be easily installed together with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- Once you have Anacaonda install [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) with 
> conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
- And install git with 
> conda install -c anaconda git 

#### Options to use R Studio
1. With conda
> conda install -c r rstudio 
2. Download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) to your local machine 
3. Alternatively you can run an Rstudio session in the [cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) by signing up for an account


## Session Materials

### [Data Visualization](https://redgar598.github.io/EMBL_BTM_2019/data_visualization/)
Here we will run through some basic ggplot examples in R. Using gene expression data across development in WT and mutant lines, to understand the utility of the ggplot system and inform about resources to go to for help in future plotting endeavours. 

### [Network Visualization](https://redgar598.github.io/EMBL_BTM_2019/network_visualization/)
Here we look at how to visualize networks in Cytoscape. Will we work through the basic file format for cytoscape, how to import data and how to display data on both the nodes and edges of a built network. Will give workshop examples on gene expression, cell connectivity data and connection of authors on publications. Networks will be built elsewhere this will just be visualizing how networks are built is not covered.
