# Beginner Python

This course is aimed at the predocs with little or no programming background with the aim of making them comfortable in coding. Even those who have programming experience in languages other than python may find this course useful in terms of relating the basic syntax.

## Install Anaconda
To run the examples in this workshop please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Additional excercises

If you have already familiarized yourself with the concepts above, we recommend you to go through this [NumPy tutorial](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf). [NumPy](https://numpy.org) is a powerful package for scientific computing designed to make your life so much easier, for example, you could do matrix multiplications without using `for-loops`!!
