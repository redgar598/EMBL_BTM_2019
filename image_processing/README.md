# Image Processing with ilastik

In this course we will learn how to segment microscopy images with a software package called ilastik.

## Requirements 

Firstly, install ilastik from [here](https://www.ilastik.org/download.html)
Afterwards download the image "2d_cells_apoptotic_1channel.png" from this GitHub folder. That is the image we are going to work with.
