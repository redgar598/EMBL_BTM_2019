# Fix me

This snakemake is broken. In general it is very similar to the one
you just looked at, but its doing a bit more and some input and 
output paths were replaced by `???`. 

Your task is to fix the paths until snakemake can run wiothout errors.

**Tip**: Use `snakemake -n` to find out whats broken.
