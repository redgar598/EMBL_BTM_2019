# Beginner Machine Learning

This course introduces basic machine learning terms and steps using open-source [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) libraries in python.

## Install and work along
To run the examples in this workshop please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/redgar598/EMBL_BTM_2019/tree/master/Install). If you created the BTM environment, please load it with

```
conda activate BTM
```
Then you can hopefully **skip** all the installation steps.

### Install Anaconda

Please use the instructions here: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

### Install git

```
conda install -c conda-forge git
```

### Install seaborn (v 0.9.0)

```
conda install -c anaconda seaborn
```

### Install mlxtend

```
conda install -c conda-forge mlxtend
```

## Useful resources

I find that the libraries, packages and functions in this field are extensively documented and there is a lot of help/already answered questions available on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to get you started. 

Some of the resources that helped me to understand the ML concepts are:
1. [EPFL Machine Learning Course CS-433](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course) by Martin Jaggi and Ruediger Urbanke on GitHub
2. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) by Christopher M. Bishop
3. [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng on Coursera
4. [Machine Learning videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF) by Josh Starmer on Youtube
