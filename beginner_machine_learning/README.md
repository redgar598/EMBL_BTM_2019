# Beginner Machine Learning

This course introduces basic machine learning terms and steps using open-source [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) libraries in python.

## Useful resources

I find that the libraries, packages and functions in this field are extensively documented and there is a lot of help/already answered questions available on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to get you started. 

Some of the resources that I find particularly useful are:
1. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop
2. [Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
3. [Machine Learning videos by Josh Starmer on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)

Feel free to add more suggestions.
