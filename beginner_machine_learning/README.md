# Beginner Machine Learning

This course introduces basic machine learning terms and steps using pandas and sklearn.

## Useful resources

I find that the libraries, packages and functions are extensively documented and there is a lot of help/already answered questions available on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to help you get started.
